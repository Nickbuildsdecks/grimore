/**
 * Card scripts: the registry of what each card actually does.
 *
 * Every card in both starter decks is here. Adding another is a few lines, and anything not here
 * still functions as cardboard — castable, a permanent if it is one, with its printed keywords read
 * from its text — it simply has no automated effect, and the log says so.
 *
 * A card may ask a question while it resolves — search a library, discard a card of your choice,
 * sacrifice a creature — by declaring `decisions`. The engine stops, asks, and hands the answers to
 * the effect. See `DecisionSpec`, and note that this is a different thing from a target in every
 * respect: asked later, sometimes of somebody else, sometimes about a hidden zone, and never
 * answerable by an opponent.
 *
 * What is still **not** scriptable with this vocabulary, stated so nobody discovers it by surprise:
 * modal spells ("choose one"), copy effects, characteristic-setting effects, and replacement
 * effects. A modal spell is the near miss — the mode is a decision, but the mode decides what the
 * spell *targets*, and targets are chosen before any of this runs. A card like that should be left
 * unscripted and resolved by hand rather than approximated.
