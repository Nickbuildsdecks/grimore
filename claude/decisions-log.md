# Grimore v2 — decisions log

Standing decisions that bind new work. Each entry says what was decided, why, and what would reverse it.
Started 2026-09-14; the original `claude/decisions-log.md` referenced in the Phase 1 brief was never
committed to the repo, so this begins fresh.

---

## D1 — The Postgres schema is the source of truth, not the legacy query

**Decided:** when a legacy handler's SQL disagrees with `packages/db/migrations/0001_baseline.sql`,
the schema wins and the query is the bug. Migrations only add what the application genuinely needs.

**Why:** `server.js` was written against SQLite and never re-verified after the Postgres cutover. Four
route groups audited so far were not merely buggy but *unable to execute* — card search, all eight
collections routes, the player profile, and all sixteen social routes. A catch-all `try/catch` hid it
in every case. The schema is the artifact that survived the cutover; the queries are what rotted.

**Reverses if:** a divergence turns out to represent a deliberate schema change that was applied to the
production database but never written back into the baseline dump. Check the live schema before
assuming that; do not assume it from the legacy code alone.

## D2 — Contracts live in `packages/shared`, and the API and the web client both import them

**Decided:** every request and response shape is a Zod contract in `packages/shared/src/contracts/`.
`apps/api` validates against it; `apps/web` imports the inferred types.

**Why:** the hand-maintained `Player` interface in `apps/web` was camelCase while both servers returned
snake_case — it never matched anything, and nothing caught that. A shared contract makes drift a
typecheck failure.

## D3 — Legacy response keys are kept as aliases during the migration

**Decided:** v2 responses use the contract's field names, with the legacy keys alongside where the
existing UI reads them (`name` next to `deck_name`; `scryfallId`, `price`, `image_uri` on cards).

**Why:** it lets the API cut over without the UI changing in the same release. Remove an alias only
when every caller has moved.

## D4 — Two API bases in the web client for the duration of the strangler

**Decided:** `apiUrl()` addresses `apps/api`; `legacyUrl()` addresses `server.js`. Un-ported routes are
called through `legacyUrl()`.

**Why:** it makes each remaining migration task visible at its call site instead of silently 404ing
after a cutover. When a route lands in `apps/api`, its `legacyUrl()` call moves to `apiUrl()` and the
migration is provably finished. **`legacyUrl()` having no remaining callers is the definition of done
for the port.**

## D5 — Blocked external services are marked, never stubbed

**Decided:** where Scryfall or Gemini is unreachable, build against the local tables and mark the
integration point `TODO(scryfall-fallback)` / `TODO(gemini)`. Never fake a response.

**Why:** a stub that returns plausible data is indistinguishable from a working integration until it
reaches production. A marked gap is honest and greppable.

## D6 — Messages use the existing `messages` table, not a new `direct_messages`

**Decided:** the social slice reads and writes `messages` (`id, sender_id, recipient_id, subject, body,
is_read, created_at`), the table the baseline schema already provides.

**Why:** legacy queries `direct_messages`, which does not exist on Postgres — so no message can ever
have been stored there and no data is at risk. Creating a second table would leave two for one concept.

**Reverses if:** Nick prefers the legacy name. It is a rename plus a migration; nothing depends on it.

## D7 — Moderation lands once, as a shared utility

**Decided:** `isProfane` filtering is not reimplemented per slice. Sites that need it are marked
`TODO(moderation)`: decks (names, tags, comments) and players (nickname, commander, bio, handles).

**Why:** four copies of a word list drift apart. One utility in `packages/shared`, one test suite.

**Landed 2026-09-14** as `packages/shared/src/moderation.ts` (47 tests) with `apps/api/src/lib/moderation.ts`
as the throwing wrapper. Legacy's word list is kept verbatim; the *matching* is rewritten, because
legacy's single `replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '')` was wrong in both directions — it joined adjacent words
("Goblins Hit Hard" → "goblinshithard"), matched substrings inside real words (`Scrap Mastery`,
`Scrapheap Scrounger`), and still let `sh1t`, `f*ck` and `f4ggot` through because the strip ran
before any folding. Matching is now per token, with a per-word allow list, leet folding, a
single-character wildcard and a deduplicating pass.

## D9 — A stacked PR does NOT retarget when its base merges

**Decided:** when landing a stack of PRs, either merge the **top** PR (which contains the whole chain)
into `main` after retargeting it, or retarget each PR to `main` before merging it. Never merge a
stacked PR while its base still points at another feature branch.

**Why:** GitHub retargets a stacked PR only when its base branch is **deleted**, not when the base is
merged. On 2026-09-14 thirteen PRs in this stack were merged in order, each into its own base branch,
so the work landed in the feature branches instead of `main` — `main` advanced by exactly one PR. No
commits were lost (the top branch held the full chain and one merge recovered it), but the merge
record is misleading: #4-#15 read as "merged" while their content reached `main` through #16.

This session's credentials also **cannot delete branches** (HTTP 403), so the delete-to-retarget route
is unavailable here. Retarget explicitly, and **verify `origin/main` actually moved after the first
merge** rather than trusting the API's `"merged": true`.

## D8 — `/api/dev/git-commit` and `/api/dev/git-push` are not ported

**Decided:** these two routes execute git operations from an HTTP endpoint. They will not be carried
into `apps/api`; they should be deleted from `server.js`.

**Why:** an HTTP endpoint that runs git commands against the server's working tree is a
remote-code-execution surface. Porting it would launder a security problem into the new codebase.

**Needs Nick's sign-off** before deleting from `server.js`, since something may call them.

# Wave plan

Ordered for efficiency. **Revised 2026-09-14** after probing which external services and schema
dependencies are actually available — the first ordering would have produced a lot of TODO-marked
shells. What is reachable from the build environment:

| Dependency | State |
| --- | --- |
| `api.scryfall.com` | **blocked** (egress proxy denies CONNECT) |
| `api.moxfield.com` | **blocked** (same) |
| Gemini | **blocked** (403) |
| Postgres / Redis | available locally |

That rules a route group "cheap" only if it is local-data-only. It also surfaced a second blocker:
**`active_roster` and `pods` are not in the baseline schema**, and `reprice-init` queries both for its
tournament deck-lock check. So the reprice suite cannot be finished until the Events wave settles the
tournament schema — which is why decks-completion moved after Events.

## Wave 1 — wishlist + recycle bin (5 routes)  *(in progress)*

`/api/wishlist` (3) and `/api/recovery` (2). Small, local-only, and each closes an open loop: wishlist
clears `TODO(wishlist-slice)` from the collections slice, and recovery makes the recycle bin
*reachable* — both the decks and collections slices already write to `deleted_items` and nothing has
ever read it back. Needs a migration: `wishlist_cards` is not in the baseline schema.

## Wave 2 — Events (19 routes)

seasons (7), roster (6), pairings (4), leaderboards (2). The largest untouched pillar and one of the
five navigation destinations `DESIGN.md` names. Also the wave that must resolve `active_roster` /
`pods` versus the baseline's `tournaments` / `tournament_players` / `tournament_rounds` / `matches`,
which unblocks Wave 3.

## Wave 3 — decks completion (10 routes)

reprice suite, Moxfield import, suggestions, autotag, share, discover variants. **Deliberately after
Events**: `reprice-init`'s deck-lock needs the tournament tables, `reprice-finalize` and
`reprice-card-cheapest` and `share` need Scryfall, and `register` / `import-account` need Moxfield.
Port the persistence and the shape; mark each external call per D5.

## Wave 4 — cards completion (6 routes)

details-batch, recommendations, swipes and art votes are local. versions and rulings need Scryfall (D5).

## Wave 5 — Play Realm (15 routes)

sandbox (9), draft (6). Depends on `apps/realtime`. `/api/sandbox/ai-advisor` needs Gemini (D5).

## Wave 6 — the long tail (~14 routes)

semantic search (2), artists (2), movers (1), preferences (1), admin (2), config (1), jobs (1),
health (1). Excludes the two `dev/git-*` routes (D8).

## Wave 7 — web cutover

Move the remaining `apps/web` pages onto the typed client, deleting each `legacyUrl()` call as its
route lands. Done when `legacyUrl()` has no callers (D4).

## Cross-cutting, any wave

- ~~The shared moderation utility (D7)~~ — landed as `packages/shared/src/moderation.ts`, wired into
  decks (name, tags, per-card tags, comments), players (profile fields, username) and league (season
  and league names). `apps/web` can call the same matcher to warn before submit; nothing does yet.
- `scryfallService.js` writes a `scryfall_id` column to `scryfall_cards` that does not exist in the
  baseline schema, so the Postgres bulk card sync cannot ever have succeeded. Needs its own fix.
- `reprice-card` uses `INSERT OR REPLACE`, which is SQLite-only syntax and raises on Postgres.

## D10 — Guest mode is removed, not ported

**Decided:** `POST /api/auth/guest` is deleted rather than ported, along with its unreferenced
frontend caller and the always-false `is_guest` / `req.session.isGuest` plumbing in `apps/api`.
Migration `0012` disables login on the legacy shared account without deleting the row.

**Why:** legacy's guest mode is one SHARED player with the hard-coded password `guestpass123`.
Every guest is the same person — one guest's decks and collection are every guest's — and because
the row is an ordinary player, that password answers the normal login form. The guest route was
never needed to reach it. Porting the design faithfully would carry both problems into the new
service; porting it *unfaithfully* (per-visitor ephemeral accounts) is a new feature, not a port.

`handleGuestLogin` in `public/app.js` had **no callers** — no button in any HTML reached it — so
removal is not a user-visible change.

Confirmed by test rather than by reading: `guest-retirement.test.ts` signs in as the seeded account
through `/api/auth/login` *before* applying 0012, so the exposure is demonstrated, then asserts the
same credentials are refused afterwards.

## D11 — Sandbox rooms stay in legacy, unported

**Decided:** the four `/api/sandbox/{create-room,join-room,sync-state,room/:code}` routes are not
ported to `apps/api` and not deleted from `server.js`.

**Why not ported:** they are an HTTP-polling multiplayer built on a process-local `sandboxRooms`
object, and they have no authentication of any kind. Room codes are `GRIM-` plus four digits — 9000
possibilities, enumerable in seconds — and `sync-state` accepts any slot id, so guessing a code
lets anyone rewrite any player's life total and battlefield. The object is never pruned, so it also
leaks memory, and being in-process it cannot survive a restart or a second worker.
`apps/realtime` already does this properly: Redis-backed `PodStore`, per-seat tokens
(`randomBytes(16)`), word-based codes with a far larger space, a reconnect grace window and rate
limiting. Carrying the legacy shape into the new service would bless an unauthenticated API.

**Why not deleted:** `public/app.js` actively calls all four, so deleting them breaks Play Realm's
multiplayer for real users today.

**Therefore:** moving Play Realm onto the `apps/realtime` Socket.IO path is its own piece of work —
a client rewrite against a different state model, not a route port — and the legacy routes stay
until that lands. The exposure above is live in the meantime; widening the code space in
`server.js` is a cheap, client-compatible mitigation if it should not wait.

## D12 — The Google admin allow list is configuration, not source

**Decided:** `ADMIN_GOOGLE_EMAILS` defaults to **empty** in the v2 env schema. Legacy defaults it to
two hard-coded personal addresses in `server.js`.

**Why:** a committed identity-to-admin grant is a standing privilege written into source, readable
by anyone with repository access and carried into every fork, branch and backup. It also silently
survives a change of ownership. Configuration is where it belongs.

**Consequence, stated plainly:** until `ADMIN_GOOGLE_EMAILS` is set in the `apps/api` environment, a
Google sign-in from an owner address creates an ordinary account instead of resolving to `p_admin`.
This only bites once auth traffic is cut over to `apps/api`; legacy is unaffected.

## D13 — The dev git routes are deleted, and D8's risk framing was overstated

**Decided:** `/api/dev/git-status`, `/api/dev/git-stage`, `/api/dev/git-commit` and
`/api/dev/git-push` are deleted, together with the scaffolding that existed only for them: the
`/changes` route, `localDevOnlyGuard`, the static-file guard for `/changes.*`, the
`child_process` import, and the hidden Command Center nav button in `public/index.html`.

**Correction to D8.** These were described across several sessions as a remote-code-execution
surface needing urgent sign-off. That was wrong, and the record should say so:

- Both `/changes` and `/api/dev` sat behind `localDevOnlyGuard`, registered *before* the routes.
- The guard's first condition is `NODE_ENV === 'production'`, and `docker-compose.yml` sets
  `NODE_ENV=production`. Every `/api/dev` request on the VM returned 404 regardless of origin.
- `public/changes.html` — the dashboard these routes served — **is not in the repository**, so
  nothing called them from anywhere.

The honest description is dead developer tooling, not a live exposure. Deleting it is still
worthwhile (a production server should not carry handlers that shell out to `git push`, guarded or
not, and dead code that looks dangerous costs reviewer attention every time it is read), but it was
never urgent, and it should not have been pressed as though it were.

**Verified by booting the server**, not by reading: `POST /api/dev/git-push` now returns Express's
own `Cannot POST /api/dev/git-push`. The `GET` variants return the SPA's `index.html`, which is how
every unmatched GET in this app already behaves.


## D14 — Legacy routes get a CI job on the dialect they actually ship on

**Decided:** a new `legacy-postgres` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` boots `server.js` against a
real Postgres 16 service and drives its write paths over HTTP
(`test/postgres-write-paths.test.js`, `npm run test:postgres`).

**Why this and not more unit tests.** Every legacy test to date runs on SQLite. Production runs on
Postgres, and `db.js` builds a *different* table under the same name per dialect. That is not a gap
mocks can close: the whole class of bug — `column "followed_id" does not exist` — only exists when a
real Postgres is asked to execute the statement. Three routes were dead in production while CI was
green.

The suite asserts rows, not status codes. A 200 proved nothing in #29 either: registration returned
500 *after* writing the player row, and an add-to-collection returned 500 after writing the card.

**The suite fails on CI rather than skipping.** It skips cleanly when `POSTGRES_TEST_URL` is unset so
a developer without Postgres is unaffected, but when `CI` is set a missing URL throws. Seven skips
reported as a pass is precisely the failure mode the overnight session recorded twice: a check that
passes when it should fail is more dangerous than no check, because it is trusted.

## D15 — Two of the five column mismatches stay deferred, and the reason is a schema decision

**Decided:** `card_price_cache.last_updated` and `scryfall_cards.scryfall_id` are left as they are.

Both sit inside `INSERT OR REPLACE` statements, which need a unique constraint Postgres does not
have — `card_price_cache` is keyed by a surrogate `id` with only a non-unique `lower(card_name)`
index, where SQLite makes `card_name` the primary key.

**The application-code alternative was considered and rejected.** UPDATE, then INSERT if nothing
matched, works without a constraint, but two concurrent callers can both insert, and
`card_price_cache` is read through a JOIN — so a duplicate row duplicates rows in card lists. Trading
a loud failure for a quiet wrong answer is the wrong trade.

The real fix is a unique index plus a dedupe of whatever is already on the VM. Both tables are
regenerable caches, which makes it low-risk, but it is still a migration against live data and
belongs with the cutover in `claude/v2-deploy-notes.md`, not smuggled into a column-rename change.

## D16 — Four of the nine SQLite-only writes are fixed; D-era claim that all nine were blocked was wrong

**Decided:** the `active_roster` check-in (both call sites) and the `player_stats` / `deck_stats`
standings rebuilds are converted to `ON CONFLICT` upserts. `KNOWN_SQLITE_ONLY` drops from 9 to 5.

**Correcting the record.** The overnight report deferred all nine with a single reason — "each needs a
unique constraint the production schema does not have." That was asserted, not checked, and it is
wrong for four of them: `active_roster` has a primary key on `player_id`, and migration `0009` gives
`player_stats` and `deck_stats` partial unique indexes. The constraints were there.

Two things were verified against a live Postgres before writing the statements, because either would
have produced a confidently broken fix:

- A partial unique index is only inferred when the statement restates its predicate. `ON CONFLICT
  (player_id, season_id) WHERE season_id IS NOT NULL` resolves; without the `WHERE` the same statement
  is rejected. Both rebuilds always pass a non-null season id.
- `INSERT OR REPLACE` deletes and reinserts, so unnamed columns reset to defaults; `DO UPDATE` does
  not. `active_roster.checked_in_at` is the only column affected, and it is set explicitly so a
  re-check-in refreshes it as it did on SQLite.

**Scope note.** This makes the statements correct, not the feature reachable: `db.js` creates
`active_roster`, `pods` and `pod_results` in neither dialect, so the league is dead on any database
`initDb` built until migration `0009` runs.

## D17 — `/api/pairings/report/:podId` is left unauthenticated, deliberately and under protest

**Decided:** not changed in this pass, and recorded here so it is not read past again.

The route mutates `pod_results`, marks the pod completed and rebuilds every standings row for the
season. There is no `req.session.player` check. The comment directly above it reads "Can be submitted
by players or admin", so a session was plainly intended, and every sibling route in the file has one.

Not fixed here because adding the check is an authorization change, not a dialect fix, and whether any
client calls it without a session has to be established rather than assumed — a wrong guess silently
breaks score reporting at an event. It wants one look at the front-end callers and then a one-line
guard.

## D18 — `card_price_cache` gets a unique key; `scryfall_cards` needed none. D15 is superseded

**Decided:** migration `0013` deduplicates `card_price_cache` and adds `UNIQUE (LOWER(card_name))`.
The four remaining cache writes become real upserts, and `KNOWN_SQLITE_ONLY` drops from 5 to 1.

**D15 said** these two tables both needed a new unique constraint, and that an application-level
upsert was the wrong trade. Investigating rather than restating that turned up two corrections:

- **`scryfall_cards` needed no index at all.** On Postgres the Scryfall UUID *is* the primary key, and
  `scryfallService.js`'s own bulk upsert already targets it. The legacy statement is now the same
  shape as that one — same key, same "refresh everything but the key" conflict clause — so the two
  writers cannot disagree about what a row means.
- **`apps/api/src/routes/decks.ts` had already shipped the application-level upsert** that D15
  rejected, as a select-then-update-or-insert, because no constraint existed. It is a real upsert now,
  which closes the race D15 correctly identified but could not avoid at the time.

**Why `LOWER(card_name)` is the right key**, checked rather than assumed. The table carries
`scryfall_id`, `set_code` and `collector_number`, which read like a per-printing cache. Nothing has
ever written a meaningful set code or collector number into it, and
`execution/migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.js` drops their NOT NULL constraints, so the migrated rows hold
NULL. Every reader joins on `LOWER(pc.card_name)` alone, and the SQLite table it came from keys on
`card_name` outright. Per-printing prices live in `scryfall_cards`, where two printings genuinely
differ by UUID — `apps/api/src/collections.test.ts` seeds exactly that. The `card_price_cache`
duplicates in that same fixture have nothing distinguishing them at all: they are the pathological
state, not a design.

**Two v2 fixtures had to change**, and neither lost its guard. `cards.test.ts` and
`collections.test.ts` both seed duplicate cache rows on purpose, to hold the readers to not fanning
out. Rather than delete a regression guard because the schema now usually prevents the condition, each
fixture drops the index for its own scope and recreates it deliberately — the index is new, and a
restore from a pre-0013 backup or a replica lagging the migration reintroduces duplicates silently.

**Order matters inside the migration.** The dedupe runs before the index creation, in the single
transaction the migrator wraps it in: the index cannot be built while duplicates exist, and a
half-applied state would leave the upsert with no target. Newest row wins, by
`cached_at DESC NULLS LAST, id DESC`. Verified on a table seeded with duplicates on purpose, including
mixed casing and a NULL `cached_at`: 6 rows to 3, the right survivor each time, idempotent on re-run.

## D19 — A mis-cased reprice was poisoning the shared price cache

**Found by** test 11 failing for a reason I had not predicted, which is the argument for driving routes
rather than reading them.

`/api/decks/reprice-card` looked its card up with an exact `card_name = ?` match. A caller whose casing
differed from the stored row found nothing, fell through to the `0.10` default, and then wrote that 10c
into `card_price_cache` — which is **shared**, so one mis-cased reprice priced that card at 10c for
every user and every deck until something overwrote it.

Now `LOWER(card_name) = LOWER(?)`, matching the wishlist fix in the same pass. Same class as the
`COLLATE NOCASE` removal; this one had the wider blast radius because the row it corrupts is global.

## D20 — The account system, and the decision to duplicate two modules on purpose

**Decided:** bring the account surface to the standard described in
`claude/account-system-design.md`, in both apps, and accept a duplicated CommonJS copy of the token
discipline and the password policy to do it.

Eleven findings, all closed in code. The ones worth repeating here because they were exploitable rather
than merely untidy:

- Reset tokens were stored **as issued**, so any read of that table — a backup, a replica, a dump — was
  a live credential for every pending reset.
- Reset rows keyed on **username**, which this app lets people change. A reset issued before a rename
  and redeemed after matched nobody, or, if someone had taken the freed username, set an
  attacker-chosen password on a **different person's account**.
- The whole recovery link was written to **stdout on every request**, so it reached every aggregated log
  and its entire retention window.
- `devResetLink` was attached whenever `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`, so one missing environment variable
  turned forgot-password into an **unauthenticated account-takeover API**.
- Legacy login wrote the identity onto whatever session the client arrived with — **session fixation**.
- A password change ended no other session, and `apps/api` carried a comment claiming it did.

**On the duplication.** `server.js` is CommonJS in a plain npm install and cannot resolve the ESM
workspace packages. The options were a bundler step, a dual build, `require()` of ESM, or two copies.
Two copies won on the condition that they are held together by a test rather than by care:
`test/account-tokens-parity.test.js` compares hashes, lifetimes, redeemability at the exact expiry
boundary, rejection messages and every password verdict, and was verified to fail when a lifetime and
then a hash algorithm were deliberately changed. Duplicated security logic plus a parity test is a
known-good arrangement; duplicated logic plus good intentions is what produced the schema divergence
this migration keeps uncovering.

**The fail-closed mailer is the other decision worth defending.** With no provider configured, every
send throws. A no-op would have been friendlier and wrong: "we have sent you a recovery link" must not
be returned when nothing was sent, and that exact false success is how the broken flow stayed unnoticed.
The cost is that recovery mail does not deliver in production until `SMTP_URL` is set, and that cost is
visible rather than hidden.
