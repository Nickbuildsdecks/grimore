# Grimore v2 — decisions log

Standing decisions that bind new work. Each entry says what was decided, why, and what would reverse it.
Started 2026-09-14; the original `claude/decisions-log.md` referenced in the Phase 1 brief was never
committed to the repo, so this begins fresh.

---

## D1 — The Postgres schema is the source of truth, not the legacy query

**Decided:** when a legacy handler's SQL disagrees with `packages/db/migrations/0001_baseline.sql`,
the schema wins and the query is the bug. Migrations only add what the application genuinely needs.

**Why:** `server.js` was written against SQLite and never re-verified after the Postgres cutover. Four
route groups audited so far were not merely buggy but *unable to execute* — card search, all eight
collections routes, the player profile, and all sixteen social routes. A catch-all `try/catch` hid it
in every case. The schema is the artifact that survived the cutover; the queries are what rotted.

**Reverses if:** a divergence turns out to represent a deliberate schema change that was applied to the
production database but never written back into the baseline dump. Check the live schema before
assuming that; do not assume it from the legacy code alone.

## D2 — Contracts live in `packages/shared`, and the API and the web client both import them

**Decided:** every request and response shape is a Zod contract in `packages/shared/src/contracts/`.
`apps/api` validates against it; `apps/web` imports the inferred types.

**Why:** the hand-maintained `Player` interface in `apps/web` was camelCase while both servers returned
snake_case — it never matched anything, and nothing caught that. A shared contract makes drift a
typecheck failure.

## D3 — Legacy response keys are kept as aliases during the migration

**Decided:** v2 responses use the contract's field names, with the legacy keys alongside where the
existing UI reads them (`name` next to `deck_name`; `scryfallId`, `price`, `image_uri` on cards).

**Why:** it lets the API cut over without the UI changing in the same release. Remove an alias only
when every caller has moved.

## D4 — Two API bases in the web client for the duration of the strangler

**Decided:** `apiUrl()` addresses `apps/api`; `legacyUrl()` addresses `server.js`. Un-ported routes are
called through `legacyUrl()`.

**Why:** it makes each remaining migration task visible at its call site instead of silently 404ing
after a cutover. When a route lands in `apps/api`, its `legacyUrl()` call moves to `apiUrl()` and the
migration is provably finished. **`legacyUrl()` having no remaining callers is the definition of done
for the port.**

## D5 — Blocked external services are marked, never stubbed

**Decided:** where Scryfall or Gemini is unreachable, build against the local tables and mark the
integration point `TODO(scryfall-fallback)` / `TODO(gemini)`. Never fake a response.

**Why:** a stub that returns plausible data is indistinguishable from a working integration until it
reaches production. A marked gap is honest and greppable.

## D6 — Messages use the existing `messages` table, not a new `direct_messages`

**Decided:** the social slice reads and writes `messages` (`id, sender_id, recipient_id, subject, body,
is_read, created_at`), the table the baseline schema already provides.

**Why:** legacy queries `direct_messages`, which does not exist on Postgres — so no message can ever
have been stored there and no data is at risk. Creating a second table would leave two for one concept.

**Reverses if:** Nick prefers the legacy name. It is a rename plus a migration; nothing depends on it.

## D7 — Moderation lands once, as a shared utility

**Decided:** `isProfane` filtering is not reimplemented per slice. Sites that need it are marked
`TODO(moderation)`: decks (names, tags, comments) and players (nickname, commander, bio, handles).

**Why:** four copies of a word list drift apart. One utility in `packages/shared`, one test suite.

**Landed 2026-09-14** as `packages/shared/src/moderation.ts` (47 tests) with `apps/api/src/lib/moderation.ts`
as the throwing wrapper. Legacy's word list is kept verbatim; the *matching* is rewritten, because
legacy's single `replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '')` was wrong in both directions — it joined adjacent words
("Goblins Hit Hard" → "goblinshithard"), matched substrings inside real words (`Scrap Mastery`,
`Scrapheap Scrounger`), and still let `sh1t`, `f*ck` and `f4ggot` through because the strip ran
before any folding. Matching is now per token, with a per-word allow list, leet folding, a
single-character wildcard and a deduplicating pass.

## D9 — A stacked PR does NOT retarget when its base merges

**Decided:** when landing a stack of PRs, either merge the **top** PR (which contains the whole chain)
into `main` after retargeting it, or retarget each PR to `main` before merging it. Never merge a
stacked PR while its base still points at another feature branch.

**Why:** GitHub retargets a stacked PR only when its base branch is **deleted**, not when the base is
merged. On 2026-09-14 thirteen PRs in this stack were merged in order, each into its own base branch,
so the work landed in the feature branches instead of `main` — `main` advanced by exactly one PR. No
commits were lost (the top branch held the full chain and one merge recovered it), but the merge
record is misleading: #4-#15 read as "merged" while their content reached `main` through #16.

This session's credentials also **cannot delete branches** (HTTP 403), so the delete-to-retarget route
is unavailable here. Retarget explicitly, and **verify `origin/main` actually moved after the first
merge** rather than trusting the API's `"merged": true`.

## D8 — `/api/dev/git-commit` and `/api/dev/git-push` are not ported

**Decided:** these two routes execute git operations from an HTTP endpoint. They will not be carried
into `apps/api`; they should be deleted from `server.js`.

**Why:** an HTTP endpoint that runs git commands against the server's working tree is a
remote-code-execution surface. Porting it would launder a security problem into the new codebase.

**Needs Nick's sign-off** before deleting from `server.js`, since something may call them.

# Wave plan

Ordered for efficiency. **Revised 2026-09-14** after probing which external services and schema
dependencies are actually available — the first ordering would have produced a lot of TODO-marked
shells. What is reachable from the build environment:

| Dependency | State |
| --- | --- |
| `api.scryfall.com` | **blocked** (egress proxy denies CONNECT) |
| `api.moxfield.com` | **blocked** (same) |
| Gemini | **blocked** (403) |
| Postgres / Redis | available locally |

That rules a route group "cheap" only if it is local-data-only. It also surfaced a second blocker:
**`active_roster` and `pods` are not in the baseline schema**, and `reprice-init` queries both for its
tournament deck-lock check. So the reprice suite cannot be finished until the Events wave settles the
tournament schema — which is why decks-completion moved after Events.

## Wave 1 — wishlist + recycle bin (5 routes)  *(in progress)*

`/api/wishlist` (3) and `/api/recovery` (2). Small, local-only, and each closes an open loop: wishlist
clears `TODO(wishlist-slice)` from the collections slice, and recovery makes the recycle bin
*reachable* — both the decks and collections slices already write to `deleted_items` and nothing has
ever read it back. Needs a migration: `wishlist_cards` is not in the baseline schema.

## Wave 2 — Events (19 routes)

seasons (7), roster (6), pairings (4), leaderboards (2). The largest untouched pillar and one of the
five navigation destinations `DESIGN.md` names. Also the wave that must resolve `active_roster` /
`pods` versus the baseline's `tournaments` / `tournament_players` / `tournament_rounds` / `matches`,
which unblocks Wave 3.

## Wave 3 — decks completion (10 routes)

reprice suite, Moxfield import, suggestions, autotag, share, discover variants. **Deliberately after
Events**: `reprice-init`'s deck-lock needs the tournament tables, `reprice-finalize` and
`reprice-card-cheapest` and `share` need Scryfall, and `register` / `import-account` need Moxfield.
Port the persistence and the shape; mark each external call per D5.

## Wave 4 — cards completion (6 routes)

details-batch, recommendations, swipes and art votes are local. versions and rulings need Scryfall (D5).

## Wave 5 — Play Realm (15 routes)

sandbox (9), draft (6). Depends on `apps/realtime`. `/api/sandbox/ai-advisor` needs Gemini (D5).

## Wave 6 — the long tail (~14 routes)

semantic search (2), artists (2), movers (1), preferences (1), admin (2), config (1), jobs (1),
health (1). Excludes the two `dev/git-*` routes (D8).

## Wave 7 — web cutover

Move the remaining `apps/web` pages onto the typed client, deleting each `legacyUrl()` call as its
route lands. Done when `legacyUrl()` has no callers (D4).

## Cross-cutting, any wave

- ~~The shared moderation utility (D7)~~ — landed as `packages/shared/src/moderation.ts`, wired into
  decks (name, tags, per-card tags, comments), players (profile fields, username) and league (season
  and league names). `apps/web` can call the same matcher to warn before submit; nothing does yet.
- `scryfallService.js` writes a `scryfall_id` column to `scryfall_cards` that does not exist in the
  baseline schema, so the Postgres bulk card sync cannot ever have succeeded. Needs its own fix.
- `reprice-card` uses `INSERT OR REPLACE`, which is SQLite-only syntax and raises on Postgres.

## D10 — Guest mode is removed, not ported

**Decided:** `POST /api/auth/guest` is deleted rather than ported, along with its unreferenced
frontend caller and the always-false `is_guest` / `req.session.isGuest` plumbing in `apps/api`.
Migration `0012` disables login on the legacy shared account without deleting the row.

**Why:** legacy's guest mode is one SHARED player with the hard-coded password `guestpass123`.
Every guest is the same person — one guest's decks and collection are every guest's — and because
the row is an ordinary player, that password answers the normal login form. The guest route was
never needed to reach it. Porting the design faithfully would carry both problems into the new
service; porting it *unfaithfully* (per-visitor ephemeral accounts) is a new feature, not a port.

`handleGuestLogin` in `public/app.js` had **no callers** — no button in any HTML reached it — so
removal is not a user-visible change.

Confirmed by test rather than by reading: `guest-retirement.test.ts` signs in as the seeded account
through `/api/auth/login` *before* applying 0012, so the exposure is demonstrated, then asserts the
same credentials are refused afterwards.

## D11 — Sandbox rooms stay in legacy, unported

**Decided:** the four `/api/sandbox/{create-room,join-room,sync-state,room/:code}` routes are not
ported to `apps/api` and not deleted from `server.js`.

**Why not ported:** they are an HTTP-polling multiplayer built on a process-local `sandboxRooms`
object, and they have no authentication of any kind. Room codes are `GRIM-` plus four digits — 9000
possibilities, enumerable in seconds — and `sync-state` accepts any slot id, so guessing a code
lets anyone rewrite any player's life total and battlefield. The object is never pruned, so it also
leaks memory, and being in-process it cannot survive a restart or a second worker.
`apps/realtime` already does this properly: Redis-backed `PodStore`, per-seat tokens
(`randomBytes(16)`), word-based codes with a far larger space, a reconnect grace window and rate
limiting. Carrying the legacy shape into the new service would bless an unauthenticated API.

**Why not deleted:** `public/app.js` actively calls all four, so deleting them breaks Play Realm's
multiplayer for real users today.

**Therefore:** moving Play Realm onto the `apps/realtime` Socket.IO path is its own piece of work —
a client rewrite against a different state model, not a route port — and the legacy routes stay
until that lands. The exposure above is live in the meantime; widening the code space in
`server.js` is a cheap, client-compatible mitigation if it should not wait.

## D12 — The Google admin allow list is configuration, not source

**Decided:** `ADMIN_GOOGLE_EMAILS` defaults to **empty** in the v2 env schema. Legacy defaults it to
two hard-coded personal addresses in `server.js`.

**Why:** a committed identity-to-admin grant is a standing privilege written into source, readable
by anyone with repository access and carried into every fork, branch and backup. It also silently
survives a change of ownership. Configuration is where it belongs.

**Consequence, stated plainly:** until `ADMIN_GOOGLE_EMAILS` is set in the `apps/api` environment, a
Google sign-in from an owner address creates an ordinary account instead of resolving to `p_admin`.
This only bites once auth traffic is cut over to `apps/api`; legacy is unaffected.

## D13 — The dev git routes are deleted, and D8's risk framing was overstated

**Decided:** `/api/dev/git-status`, `/api/dev/git-stage`, `/api/dev/git-commit` and
`/api/dev/git-push` are deleted, together with the scaffolding that existed only for them: the
`/changes` route, `localDevOnlyGuard`, the static-file guard for `/changes.*`, the
`child_process` import, and the hidden Command Center nav button in `public/index.html`.

**Correction to D8.** These were described across several sessions as a remote-code-execution
surface needing urgent sign-off. That was wrong, and the record should say so:

- Both `/changes` and `/api/dev` sat behind `localDevOnlyGuard`, registered *before* the routes.
- The guard's first condition is `NODE_ENV === 'production'`, and `docker-compose.yml` sets
  `NODE_ENV=production`. Every `/api/dev` request on the VM returned 404 regardless of origin.
- `public/changes.html` — the dashboard these routes served — **is not in the repository**, so
  nothing called them from anywhere.

The honest description is dead developer tooling, not a live exposure. Deleting it is still
worthwhile (a production server should not carry handlers that shell out to `git push`, guarded or
not, and dead code that looks dangerous costs reviewer attention every time it is read), but it was
never urgent, and it should not have been pressed as though it were.

**Verified by booting the server**, not by reading: `POST /api/dev/git-push` now returns Express's
own `Cannot POST /api/dev/git-push`. The `GET` variants return the SPA's `index.html`, which is how
every unmatched GET in this app already behaves.
